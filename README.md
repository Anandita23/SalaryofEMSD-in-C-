# SalaryofEMSD-in-C-
*/An organization needs to develop a salary processing application for its staff members. At present it has an engineering division only where engineers and managers work. Every engineer reports to some Manager. Every Manager can also work like engineer. In future, it may add director to the team. It can also have a sales executive and they will come under the category of employee. The salary processing logic will be different for all the positions. I learnt about this problem from the "Programming of Java" from  NPTEL./*
